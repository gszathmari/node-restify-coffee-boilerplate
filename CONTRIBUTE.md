## Adding new features

* New features are welcome. Just create a pull request and our team will review it.

* You can look through the existing bugs on [Github](https://github.com/gszathmari/node-restify-coffee-boilerplate/issues) too

* Look at existing bugs and help us understand if
 - The bug is reproducible?

# Documentation

This section includes any help you need with the documentation and where it can be found. Code needs explanation, and sometimes those who know the code well have trouble explaining it to someone just getting into it.

* New API features must be documented in the  [API blueprint](apiary.apib) file

it’s used in daily life. Take screenshots and make videos!
